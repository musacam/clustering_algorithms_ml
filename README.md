# Clustering Algorithms Comparison Under Different Conditions
 This repository contains 9 different clustering algorithms. Main goal of this project is to compare those algorithms under different criteria:
 Comparison made on small dataset (which is Star Classification dataset with 240 row) and large dataset (E-Commerce shipping dataset with over 10k row).
 Comparison made on PCA applied data and raw data.
 
 ## Following clustering algorithms have implemented:
 - K-Means
 - OPTICS
 - Affinity Propagation
 - Agglomerative Clustering
 - Hierarchy Dendrogram
 - DBSCAN
 - MeanShift
 - Mini Batch K-Means
 - Birch

 
 ## How to use it?
 Load the needed modules. And run it `stars.py` for small dataset visualization. `E-Commerce.py` for large dataset visualization.
